# Notes from Feb. 2017:

4 basic changes in the nature of www.kwootc.ca have occurred in the last 3 years:

1. Number of locations reduced from 14 to 4.
- Trinity, St. Andrew's; Benton St. / Dream Centre / Ray of Hope; St. Matthew's, Ste. Anne's; St. John's; First, WK Mennonite; Bethany, Stirling; Waterloo Mennonite, Stirling.

2. K-W OOTC has ceased doing overnight.

3. www.kwootc.ca is no longer canting towards being a homelessness information hub / resource, be it for guests, (KWOOTC) locations, or volunteers. Instead of trying to reinvent that wheel, what links remain point towards such that are more likely to be more vigorously maintained. e.g. Link to RoW publications of area resources rather than duplicating that information, which also creates points of www. maintenance / details to track. RoW will already be doing so - no point in www.kwootc.ca duplicating that effort, particularly given limited volunteer time / familiarity with ecosystem.

4. www.kwootc.ca is no longer canting towards being a complete information resource for / about volunteering at K-W OOTC. There is currently less commonality / joint efforts between the locations, though significant commonality does still remain. e.g. Joint training no longer occurs; each location has their own, and inherently includes the specifics for their location that common training could not. Given that all locations now present their own individual training processes, it's been deemed unacceptable to require volunteers to attend two, largely but not entirely, duplicate training regimens. Further, there has been less emphasis of what is, and why the need for, homelessness supports, as opposed / in addition to, the unique per location's operational specifics.

- the consequence for www.kwootc.ca is to reduce the amount of generic material inherently duplicated at each location, in favour of showing samples and noting all sites will have similar, but not identical, material. (No point duplicating the wheel.) e.g. Handwashing, various safety issues.

As a result of the above, some content text bits from prior versions of www.kwootc.ca no longer appear. Some have been saved below for possible past / future reference.


The Out of the Cold program is completely volunteer run. Prior to the start of
the season, we provide training in four key areas:

- Crisis Intervention
- Health & Safety Issues
- Mental Health Issues
- Site Orientation

*This will give you, the volunteer the tools to deal with simple situations.
Realize that you will never be asked to work alone and someone will always be
there with experience to lead you.*


- Job Descriptions
- Volunteer Code of Ethics
- Fire Evacuation Procedures
- Important Phone Numbers
- Personal Safety Precautions
- Proper Hand Washing

- difference between general public and volunteers is volunteers show up and pitch in.

- You are not expected to be here for the duration of the program, but the desk
must be manned at all times once we open, BUT this job will be on the list for
all shifts.

- Remember it is easier to not allow someone in, than to try and remove them
later.

- not responsible for lost or stolen items.

We are hear to create a welcoming atmosphere for our guests, but we work with other volunteers, not guests. At most locations, Guests are discouraged from helping

# Personal Safety Precautions

## To Protect Yourself Against Injury:

- In the winter with people coming and going the floors can become slippery.
Wear appropriate footwear. Please use the mop to areas as dry as possible.
- In the kitchen, by the microwave, near the communication kit is a small first
aid kit.
- Ten volunteers took first aid training this summer. We have a few others,
hopefully covering most shifts.
- The key to keeping yourself safe is to be aware of what is going on around
you.

## To Protect Yourself Against Liability

- Always stay in public areas, do not go into any area alone, especially with a
guest.
- Take a buddy with you Never interact with a guest alone.
- We are hear to create a welcoming atmosphere for our guests, but we work with
other volunteers, not guests. At most locations, ***<u>Guests are discouraged
from helping</u>***

## To Protect Yourself Against Disease

- All spills are to be quickly cleaned up. Wear glove, use paper towels and
dispose of garbage in a double bag.. Bedding to be laundered is placed in the
laundry baskets.
- Your best protection is to wear gloves when you are dealing with either a
spill or cleanup. (ie, unplugging toilets) Remember to wash your hands after
removing your gloves..
- Hazardous materials are to be disposed of appropriately. This means that any
human fluids should be double bagged and taken away from the area as quickly as
possible.
- Dispose of any sharps in the sharps containers in any first floor washroom.

***Hand washing is your best defence***

Please record in the communications book any safety concerns you might have or
experience.


&nbsp;

# Fire Evacuation Procedures

In case of a fire, be methodical. Move people quickly and calmly to the exit.
Our main  staging area would be the Main Entrance exit  However other exits we
might use are to the parking lot, or to other designated areas.

- At the start of your shift, learn where all the exits are.
- If people are sleeping, wake people calmly and quickly, notifying them of the
nearest exit. Remember, we might have people sleeping in multiple areas.
- Check that no one is in a bathroom.
- Take both the Volunteer and Guest sign-in sheets to help determine if all are
out of the building.
- Gather outside the Main Entrance.
- The church has an alarm system, once it sounds all must
evacuate the building.
- Do not worry about any contents, just worry about getting
everyone out of the building.
- Once you have left the building, no can re-enter until the fire department
gives the OK.
- **Do not try to put the fire out yourself.**


***In all cases of fire our number one priority is the safe and orderly
evacuation of both our guests and volunteers.***

&nbsp;

## Safe Food Handling

*When preparing food, cleanliness is most important. Wash your hands frequently.*

- Sanitizer (Bleach) bottle is newly mixed before we begin. (Good for 24 hours)
- Always wear an apron.
- Wash your hands often.
- Gloves are only necessary if your hands have cuts etc.
- Wash dishes in the dishwasher when possible and let air dry.
- Otherwise use the three sink method – Wash – Rinse – Sanitize
- Hot foods to be kept hot, Cold foods kept cold.
- Any food brought in from outside must be entered in the Food Sign In book.
- Serve only what you would serve at home. i.e. Would you eat it?

***Remember to wash your hands before handling food, and wash them again
frequently during work***


Volunteers must wash their hands:

- after visiting the toilet
- after handling raw food
- after using a handkerchief or nasal tissue
- after handling garbage
- after touching your ears, nose, mouth or other parts of the body
- after smoking

***Note: Food handling staff must not work when they are suffering from
diseases which are likely to be transmitted through food***

## Proper Hand Washing - How to Wash Your Hands Effectively

<table><tr>
<td><img src="{{"/assets/images/washhands.jpg"|relative_url}}" alt="Proper Hand Washing"></td>
<td><ol>
<li> Take some paper towel off the roll. </li>
<li> Turn on the water. </li>
<li> Wet hands and apply soap. </li>
<li> Scrub thoroughly, between fingers around rings, etc.
	<br> - A good idea of the time necessary at this step is
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;to sing “<i>Happy Birthday</i>” while you’re washing.
</li>
<li> Dry hands thoroughly with the paper towel. </li>
<li> Take paper towel, and place on taps to turn them off.
     <br>(You don’t want your clean hands to be dirtied by the tap.)
</li>
<li> Dispose of paper towel. </li>
</ol></td></tr></table>

*The secret to effective hand washing is time and vigorous action.*

***Even though we provide hand sanitizers, washing your hands properly is still
better. Hand sanitizers will breed more resistant bacteria, whereas proper
washing removes them. Hand sanitizers should only be used when hand washing is
unavailable.***

&nbsp;

## Crisis Management

### What to do in a Crisis

Typically, only a few volunteers are needed to deal with most problems, the rest
of us are more effective if we stay with the other guests and keep them calm and
out of the way. The more we can keep to our normal routine, the calmer our other
guests will remain. Try to be aware of where everyone is. (Watch the lead, and
watch each others backs.) You should not stay beside each other, but you do want
to be within sight in case more help is needed.

***For your own safety and protection try not to deal with any issue alone or not within sight of
another volunteer.***

When you are confronting someone who is upset:

- Keep yourself calm
- Move towards other volunteers
- Do not stand within arms reach
- Stand where they can see you, but not in a confrontational way. Keep one side of
your body facing them
- Maintain eye contact
- If you feel unsafe at any time, retreat toward the kitchen.
- Remember afterwards to record the incident, all details and the resolution in
the Communications Book.

*Remember, there usually only needs to a few of us dealing with the incident.
Everyone else needs to be keeping others calm and keeping operations running as
smoothly and normally as possible.*
