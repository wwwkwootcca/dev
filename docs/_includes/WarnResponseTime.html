Please note that KWOOTC has no staff and is entirely operated by volunteers
during their available spare time. During our season, November through April,
particularly before December, it <i>can</i> take more than a week to receive a
response. Outside our season, it can take several times longer. If you have not
received a response in a timely fashion, please consider calling the Friday or
other site, as listed at <a href="/Locations" title="KWOOTC Locations"
rel="locations">Locations</a>.
