### The coordinator at St. Johns Lutheran Church had 3 students do a project on Out of the Cold in Feb 2010. The movie below is from their presentation.

**Out of the Cold - Lyrics**
<br>By: Matthew Hintermayer, Brittany Kane, and Mike Chadwick
<br>*(This song is about how homeless are looked down upon and how
<br>people should realize that a lot of them lost everything that they had)*

<div style="column-count:2;-webkit-column-count:2;-moz-column-count:2;">

The world we live in is full of the rich and the poor.
<br> Sometimes their silence says more then their words ever could.
<br>
<br> Ever could
<br>
<br> Few possessions left to hold onto.
<br> No companion by my side.
<br> Left out on the street for the night.
<br> Out in the cold I sleep tonight.
<br>
<br> The way this happened was far from your thoughts, so unreal.
<br> I had it all but was torn through the worst of times.
<br>
<br> But thank God its not you tonight.
<br>
<br> **(solo)**
<br>
<br> *(Quietly)*
<br> But thank god its not you tonight X2
<br>
<br> I don’t know, and I don’t see,
<br> What this world has against me
<br> But these lives that we have lived
<br> And these things we could be.
<br>
<br> A distant light is forming now,
<br> But it’s just slightly out of reach
<br> One last look at the sight, (one last breath I close my eyes)
<br> One last chance to make it right.
<br>
