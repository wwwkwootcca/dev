<div style="column-count:2;-webkit-column-count:2;-moz-column-count:2;">

Little did I know as I sat at the door
<br> We would feed and sleep 50 or more
<br> It seems to be somewhat insane
<br> It seems to be quite profane
<br>
<br> They don’t seem different from me
<br> Why are they on the street you see
<br> I have a home and others do not
<br> What is that I have got
<br>
<br> A young man comes in, his pregnant wife in tow
<br> I feel like I should say to them, you know
<br> It is not a good thing to do
<br> To have a child when you live like you do
<br>
<br> But then I stop and I think
<br> Who am I to raise such a stink
<br> Maybe they have a place to go
<br> That is away from the cold and the snow
<br>
<br> A single women enters in
<br> She can’t be more than fifteen
<br> She is cold and shivering I see
<br> But still she thanks me for the candy
<br>
<br> Another comes in and asks for a bed
<br> I ask him, if he wishes to be fed
<br> His eyes so tired look at me
<br> Saying I really don’t care, just take care of me
<br>
<br> I think what hurts me the most
<br> To see those who have given up hope
<br> They seem to be depressed, discouraged, lifeless, not free
<br> Dejected, discarded, forgotten, so disposable., so empty
<br>
<br> What is it that we do to these
<br> How is it we let them freeze
<br> Can we not share, on this planet
<br> With them the gifts we take for granted
<br>
<br> How do we give them hope for the future
<br> The only way is to nurture
<br> To treat each as a gift from God
<br> That is all any can ask, by God
<br>
<br> And if you wonder aloud like me
<br> What will it take to change the greed
<br> It must start with you and me
<br> Working to make them free
