Out Of The Cold, a man came in
<br>His jacket all torn, ripped and thin
<br> How it kept the cold away I do not know
<br> My offer to hang it up, was met with a NO!
<br>
<br> “My coat is more valuable than gold”
<br> “It does more than keep out the cold”
<br> “It carries all I own in its fold”
<br> “Except what I can wear”, I was told.
<br>
<br> Now could this be a fable? I thought
<br> Could a coat be that valuable? But
<br> Were not other things more important to him?
<br> Than a coat all torn, threadbare and thin?
<br>
<br> He continued his tale, I sat most devout,
<br> “When I was sixteen my mom threw me out”
<br> “Now you may think it was sad”
<br> “But really it was not that bad”
<br>
<br> “I found a place on the streets for free”
<br> “Joining the bikers, a new family”
<br> “My jacket spoke for me that day”
<br> “It let them know I was O.K.”
<br>
<br> “My jacket opens doors, speaks aloud for me”
<br> “It is a powerful passport, much like I.D.”
<br> “With a single look people can see”
<br> “My whole life’s history”
<br>
<br> Then I left him to his dinner you see
<br> As it was my turn to eat for free
<br> And then I overheard a woman complain,
<br> “I only wish I had warm mittens again”
<br>
<br> I just turned around
<br> She was easily found
<br> Bare hands and a coat so torn and thin
<br> I gave her my mitts to keep her hands in
<br>
<br> But she said “What about your hands, sir”
<br> “Won’t they get cold and need the fur?”
<br> I said “I’ve many other pairs, so you see
<br> I can gladly give you these mittens from me"
<br>
<br> I went downtown today
<br> To shop and walk the way
<br> My eyes have been opened, now I can see
<br> The people to help are all around me
<br>
<br> Again I saw a torn old cloak
<br> I thought to me about these folk
<br> How could it be in a land of plenty
<br> That they were cold and so hungry
<br>
<br> They seem to be
<br> So much like me
<br> Have we forgotten humanity
<br> In our most modern society
<br>
<br> How could a coat to keep out the cold
<br> Become worth more than precious gold
<br> I asked my God, why not free
<br> All these people from their misery
<br>
<br> He spoke aloud to me that day
<br> “I made you to help in the way”
<br> “When you help them, you help Me”
<br> “To remove suffering eternally”
<br>
<br> “No one will be cold or hungry”
<br> “No one in pain or even angry”
<br> “All can be free on that day”
<br> “To live and fear not, OK!”
<br>
<br> “All this can happen my son,”
<br> “You must believe it can be done”
<br> “I cannot do it all alone you see”
<br> “That is why I make people like thee.”
