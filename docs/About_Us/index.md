# Out of the Cold History
{:#history}

In 1986, the death of George, a homeless man befriended by the students and
staff of St. Michaelâ€™s High School in Toronto, brought people together to take
action. Students and staff at the school, Sister Susan Moran, Father John Murphy
and the Reverend Canon John Erb, took necessary steps to arrange a location,
food and volunteers. On January 15, 1988 they opened a small storefront on St.
Clair Avenue in Toronto.

Without specifically planning so, the first
provision of service also revealed the special nature of the service for both
the volunteers and guests. Each group grew in humanity by participating in the
program; the guest by experiencing from the volunteers a genuine concern; and
the volunteers, by learning to earn the respect and appreciation of the guests.

## History in Kitchener-Waterloo

In February of 1999, a two month pilot project was run at First United Church,
Waterloo. In the fall of 1999, three more churches opened their doors to the
homeless. In January of 2000 another church opened its doors to provide
overnight shelter only. We have had seven sites available for the program since
the fall of 2000.

&nbsp;

## Today ...

For many years, replacements were found when locations became unable to continue their programs. Over the years, perhaps as many as 15 different organizations opened their doors at different times, with uncounted more  participating in feeder or other supportive roles. For a number of years 11 different locations were simultaneously active during the coldest months of the year. However, by the fall of 2015, due to individually unique operational issues, all KWOOTC *overnight* programs had ceased.

[June 25, 2015 - The Record](//www.therecord.com/news-story/5696887-closed-last-out-of-the-cold-homeless-shelter-ends-overnight-stays-in-waterloo/ "Closed: Last Out of the Cold homeless shelter ends overnight stays in Waterloo"){:target="_blank"}

The feeling and impetus that brought life to K-W OOTC, remains. All current locations continue their evening meal programs.

# Steering Committee
{:#SteeringCommittee}

An Out Of The Cold *Steering Committee* composed of the coordinator(s) and/or their designate(s) may meet a few times a year to discuss mutual issues. It can aid in providing training, coordinated information sessions, and oversee operation of the common program within the community.

&nbsp;


# Common Rules For Our Guests
{:#GuestRules}

The following is not permitted at any K-W OOTC location:

- Violence in word or deed.
- Weapons or potential weapons
- Alcohol, tobacco or other substances

*Although smoking is permitted* outside, *no* other *alcohol or substance use is permitted <u>anywhere</u> upon the property.*

*Items may be left with the front desk upon arrival for return when leaving - leave them at your own risk. We will* not *be responsible for lost, stolen, or otherwise misplaced items.*

&nbsp;

## Confidentiality

Our guests are to be treated with dignity and respect at all times. Consistent
with that overriding emphasis is the importance of respecting the right to
privacy and confidentiality. If we succeed in creating a warm and
welcoming atmosphere it is possible that our guests will share with some of us
their hurts and personal information. It is our commitment that any such
personal information be kept confidential.
