# About Them

&nbsp;

"They have no [hope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope "Hope is an optimistic attitude of mind that is based on an expectation of positive outcomes related to events and circumstances in one's life ..."){:target="_blank"}." <sub>&#8208;&#8208; CSS</sub>

&nbsp;

I do not believe you can be homeless and not be [depressed](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood) "a state of low mood and aversion to activity that can affect a person's thoughts, behavior, feelings, and sense of well-being"){:target="_blank"}.
<br>- Note that despair redirects to depression. Begging the question, can you be homeless and not in despair? Being in _despair_, is it any wonder ...

It's all about mental health - something _very_ people time intensive to deal with, and thus _very expensive_.

I've heard it said that we build our lives on three pillars: Home, Work, and Family. Lose one, and someone well balanced will likely be able to cope and get through it. Lose two, possibly, but help and lots of support will likely be needed - mostly, but not always, coming from one's (extended) family. Lose all three ... and all bets are off.

Now suppose you are an addicted, perhaps even abused, or both, youth - not yet with the life skills needed to make your way in the world. Or your parents were - not usually superb role models to go forth from.

Or in a small, perhaps distant, community with few or no resources, ability, or awareness, to help. People being entirely occupied with just trying to get through their own lives, themselves.

Or perhaps you've been injured, and become addicted to _prescribed_ pain killers. You lose your job. _(1 pillar.)_ Then, through financial difficulty, you lose your rental. _(2nd pillar.)_ And through the stress of the unbearable situation, you become _temporarily_ unbearable - and you lose your family. _(3rd pillar.)_ Once it's gone - it's gone. Even if you replace it later with something else - when, if, should, later ever come. Some day. That isn't today.

Is it any wonder ... <sup>*</sup>

How do you even begin to put your life back together, by this point?

"Would you want one of them serving you a coffee at Tim Horton's<sup>&reg;</sup>?" <sub>&#8208;&#8208; unknown</sub>

"Would your hire one of them to serve coffee, if _you_ ran a Tim Horton's<sup>&reg;</sup>" <sub>&#8208;&#8208; unknown</sub>

So just what is it they are supposed to do? Pull themselves up by their bootstraps? ... to where, exactly?

Remember, Ontario Works support is insufficient for even a bachelor's apartment.

Suicide should come as no surprise to anyone. Nor should withdrawal into the insidiousness of [addiction](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction "a brain disorder characterized by compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli, despite adverse consequences."){:target="_blank"} - compounding the problem.

[Why Poor People's Bad Decisions Make Perfect Sense](//www.huffingtonpost.com/linda-tirado/why-poor-peoples-bad-decisions-make-perfect-sense_b_4326233.html "Linda Tirado"){:target="_blank"}

To be fair - in the end, it is truth that only you can help you. You have to be ready and willing to help yourself, and take advantage of the offers of help and the hands being held out to you.

Begs the questions though ... how did our society manage to create the conditions by which you aren't ready yet, and how do we create the conditions whereby you are able to get through this time until you are ready?

How do we get back to [hope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope "Hope is an optimistic attitude of mind that is based on an expectation of positive outcomes related to events and circumstances in one's life ..."){:target="_blank"}?

&nbsp;

Which is all to say - it's all about _mental health_. A _<u>medical</u> issue_.

Only government has the capacity or resources to deal with mental health - it involves _all_ levels of government.
^
- local housing intensification / zoning
- Provincial Health
- Federal Housing Strategy
- Housing Cost (e.g. Ontario Works benefits doesn't even cover the cost of a bachelor apartment, to get a decent night's sleep, to be able to go out and look for work the next day. Assuming any _medical_ issues have _been_, past tense, dealt with.)
- Food Cost (even if there was anything left)

Being a volunteer, evening only program, nothing we can do. Except point you, the concerned, towards [Community]({{"/Community"|relative_url}} "X").

That's a tough thing to say. Very hard. Sounds like giving up, or throwing our hands up. But being an evening program, when all the support services lie elsewhere, during _'banker's_ (non-evening) _hours'_, and thus unwilling to connect or participate with us during the times during which our programs run, we have no expertise to apply to this very complex societal deficiency, let alone to the _specifics of each individual's situation and unique needs_. We at OOTC don't have the ability or capacity to make a difference to the problem of homelessness - _except_ through our _advocacy_. (And it's a complicated world out there, with many needs. I envy no politician - trying to help get the best result from scarce resources. When everyone's definition of 'best' is different. Two car garage with two incomes, high taxes,  and small children, vs no safe, secure, and private place to lay one's head down at night. Whom's best is _best_?)

On the other hand, when you cross our threshhold, it doesn't matter what happened on the other side of it, how or why you got there - it only matters that you did. You're hungry, and tired, and it's cold outside. Welcome. Come in. Take a load off. Rest. Have some supper, in a friendly environment, without judgement or preaching.

It's a band aid. We know it's a band aid. But our numbers demonstrate it's a very necessary one. We wish we didn't have any guests - but we do. Take our guests, please! Go ahead, put us out of business - we'll help.

In the mean time, we hope tomorrow is just a bit better for you than today. And the next one. And the next one. If you can make it through to it. We'll help you.

And if it doesn't happen, and you need us again - we're _still_ here. And you're _always welcome_. Doesn't matter why, nor how many times you've been before - you're cold and hungry and tired, right now. We'll help.

Welcome.

<sup>*</sup> The real wonder is society's apparent mutual fantasy ([Wishful Thinking](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishful_thinking "the formation of beliefs and making decisions according to what might be pleasing to imagine instead of by appealing to evidence, rationality, or reality."){:target="_blank"}) that a _[magic wand](http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Magic_Wand "Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo"){:target="_blank"}_ will somehow appear out of thin air, to just be waved and somehow _make it all better_ [.](http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/File:September182.gif ""){:target="_blank"}

What would you do if you lost your job, then your home, then your family ...
<br>- It's just you. You are _alone_! Everyone else is occupied with their own lives.

'course, most of us say, we would never allow things to get to that point.

No doubt _they_ said the same.

Remember ... by this point, you'd by on the far side of this _unimaginable_ abyss. What you have today, friends, family, a roof over your head in your own space, food, would be but a distant memory. One you might possibly think of as some fantasy that happened to someone else, in some other lifetime.

"How _did_ I get _here_!" Regardless of the answer ... _Here you be._

So much cheaper, so much less grief, to never let it happen in the first place. If happiness begets happiness ...

We cannot do it alone, or in isolation.

It's not _somebody else's problem_, it's _everyone's problem_. And we need everyone to _step up_ and to put _their own direct <u>time</u>_ into addressing it.

Please let your [local political representatives](http://kitchener.foundlocally.com/Local/Government.asp "Kitchener-Waterloo Government, Politicians & Poltics Resources and Info") know of your concerns. Work with like minded friends, neighbours, acquantances - let them know that a significant part of _their constituency_ wants _them_ to collectively work on it, harder.
