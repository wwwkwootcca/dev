#### January 12, 2017: [The Record](http://www.therecord.com/ " "){:.src} - [Out of the Cold continues feeding homeless](http://www.therecord.com/news-story/7063702-out-of-the-cold-continues-feeding-homeless/ " "){:target="_blank"}

❝WATERLOO REGION — The Out of the Cold program continues to provide vital support to Waterloo Region's homeless despite scaled back operations in recent winters.❞

❝❝While the Out of the Cold program has changed, we do continue with the four sites,❞ said facilitator Cathie Stewart Savage. ❝It's not as busy, but it's still busy.❞❞

❝❝For some of us, we've continued the program because of the other needs we'd been meeting,❞ said Stewart Savage, also co-ordinator of the Friday evening program at First United Church in Waterloo.❞

❝St. Matthews Lutheran Church in Kitchener looks after Wednesday night, along with breakfast on Thursday morning; Stirling Avenue Mennonite Church in Kitchener covers Saturday night; and Sunday night is hosted by Saint Louis Roman Catholic Church in Waterloo.❞

❝Along with providing a nourishing meal, the churches offer company and a chance to socialize. They're seeing people who didn't go to Out of the Cold's overnight program now joining the evening meal.❞

❝❝For those few people who stay, it's like a vital community touch for them to be able to do that,❞ said Stewart Savage, who has been volunteering with Out of the Cold from the beginning.❞

❝The region has six emergency shelters including the Cambridge Shelter, Lutherwood Safe Haven, Charles Street Men’s Hostel, YWCA Shelter, oneROOF and Argus Residence.❞

❝If there are ever more people than beds, the region has the ability to rent motel rooms so nobody has to sleep outside.❞

❝❝People are staying longer (in emergency shelters) for many reasons, one of which is lack of appropriate housing that is affordable to move into,❞ said Deb Schlichter, director of housing services.❞

❝In the past few years, the Region of Waterloo’s ❝Out of the Cold❞ program has transitioned. It no longer offers overnight stays, and instead limits the visit to meals only, with most locations doors closing between 8 pm and 10 pm.❞

❝The program originally started as a short-term fix for fighting homelessness in the Region, but ended up running for the past 15 years.❞

❝Deb Schlichter, the Director of Housing Services for the Region says, ❝we’re really looking at ending homelessness, and to end homelessness we need to find appropriate places for homes, for everybody rather than just a temporary accommodation.❞❞

❝As Out of the Cold (OOTC) ramps up for its 17th year, it will be the first time it won’t be offering overnight shelter.❞

❝program, which will now only serve hot meals, show movies and offer companionship to those living on the street❞

❝At its height, OOTC operated at 11 locations throughout Kitchener and Waterloo and provided a warm meal and a place to stay for the region’s homeless every night of the week at local churches.❞

❝Now, the program has been reduced to four locations, each offering a hot meal and remaining open until about 10 pm.❞

❝Those sites are: Stirling Avenue Mennonite Church (Saturday, 57 Stirling Ave. N., Kitchener), St. Louis Roman Catholic Church (Sunday, 53 Allen St. E., Waterloo), St. Matthew’s Lutheran Church (Wednesday, 54 Benton St., Kitchener) and First United Church (Friday, 16 William St. W., Waterloo).❞


❝❝The real answer isn’t Out of the Cold, it’s housing and personal supports,❞ said Stewart Savage.❞
